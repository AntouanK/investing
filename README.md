## About

A lot of you know me from my comments and posts on Reddit's /r/personalfinance. I have also recently been spending a lot of time at /r/dataisbeautiful as well. This started off as my first dataviz project a while back. I downloaded [some data based on Robert Shiller's work](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/tree/master/data) and went crazy with it. Now that I've finally settled in and gotten other projects completed, I picked this one back up and decided to finally drive it to completion.

> "Warren, it strikes me that if you did nothing else you never sell. That is, if you can grit your teeth through and just disregard short-term declines in the market or even long-term declines in the market, you will come out well. I mean you just stick all your money in stocks and go home and don’t look at your portfolio you’ll do far better than if you try to trade it." - Alan Greenspan
